## Context
The work is for a genuinte website created in response to a request from a neighbouring village. It is a voluntary exercise. 

## Objectives
The objective was to create a responsive website, to include general information, forthcoming events and with a link to the village newsletter, and another link to an existing village show site. The website needs to be updated regularly, so must be easily maintainable.

## Specification
The website should include an image gallery on the landing page, a navigation bar and hidden dropdown menus to be activated on hover. Prototypes, including required menu items, were provided by a local graphic designer, who also provided the village logo, some photos and specified the colour scheme. 

## Response
The website includes a fade-in / fade-out photo gallery adapted from an open source JavaScript program and a navigation bar with dropdown boxes activated on hover using JavaScript. The mobile phone styling includes a menu icon which toggles the main navigation menu on and off using click, as well as sub-menus that are also made visible / hidden in response to a mouse click also using Javascript. To maximise clarity on small screens the mobile version uses full opacity for the sub menus. The article text is in black on a very light grey background to reduce glare, and has been set to 16px so as to render legibly on all screen sizes.

## Acknowledgements
This project is a valuable opportunity to work as a team with an experienced graphic designer, and to explore JavaScript as a tool to create a real interactive site.
